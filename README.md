## Getting Started

After cloning, run ```npm install```

Then you may run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

For the standardized theme for components, we will be using shadcn, a ui library for react. Refer here for the complete list of components:
https://ui.shadcn.com/

We can easily modify the theme later on via tailwind, for now we can maybe stick to the basic theme shadcn provides.

included themed components are:
- button
- card
- input
- label
